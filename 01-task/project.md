# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) iOS Immersive: Pre-Course Assignment

Your pre-course assignment has three parts. Please complete ***all three parts*** before the first day of class:

## Pt. 1: Get the repo!
* Open the terminal! 
* Using the command line, navigate into your `Documents` directory. 
* Create a new folder called `Repositories` and then navigate into that. 
* Create a sub-folder called `GA-iOS` and navigate into that.
* `Clone` this remote pre-course repository into your local "GA-iOS" folder by running the following command: 
```git clone https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/iOSI-course-materials.git```
* This will clone our pre-course repository onto your computer! Just make sure you've navigated to your local "GA-iOS" directory in the command line before running the `clone` command, or else you won't know where your local copy might end up!

## Pt. 2: Complete all of the `TODOs` in the [included Playground file](./PreWork.playground/Contents.swift)
* Open `PreWork.playground` in Xcode and use your new Swift knowledge to complete all of the `TODO` exercises. 
* When you're finished, uncomment the test code at the bottom to check if your answers are valid!
* Make sure to **save** your file when you're finished. 
* Use the command line to rename your file to `prework.[yourname].playground`

## Pt. 3: Start your first app!
* Create a new XCode project: a "Single View" iOS app. Do not use core data, unit tests, or UI tests. 
* Name the app file like so: `[yourname]-precourse-app`
* Place the file in your local `02-onboarding-task` folder.
* Navigate into Main.storyboard and add a picture of yourself plus a label that says your name.
* Run the app and make sure that both show up. They do not have to be aligned particularly well, but they do need to show up.
* BONUS: When you tap on your image in the app, navigate to a new screen which displays only your image

### Submission

Use your newfound terminal & git knowledge to submit your work!

1. Navigate to remote X
2. Create branch Y
3. Create pull request from local copy Z

* Make sure to title your saved playground and app files with your name!

> Note: Instructors should ask students to either check in their pre-course work to their own fork or submit a pull request to the course directory.

### Feedback

* **Playground File**: Students should use the inline error-checking and test code provided (uncomment the code at the bottom of the file) to review their work.
* **Single View App**: Students should submit their work to their course github repository.

Your instructors will use [the following rubric](./assessment-rubric.md) to score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_
