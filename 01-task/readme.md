Welcome to the iOS Development Immersive at General Assembly! We're really excited that you're joining our General Assembly community. In order to ensure your success in the course, weâ€™ve created a series of pre-course on-boarding tasks that will take most students between 30-40 hours to complete.

Please complete **all** items **before** your first day of class, so that both you and your computer will be prepared to hit the ground running. If you have questions in the meantime (or just want to say hi!), feel free to reach out to your instructional team!

Sincerely,

GA + your iOS Immersive Team

#### Technology Policy

Due to the necessary tools used for iOS development, **Macs are required** for this course. We strongly suggest that students bring laptops with screens of *at least 13-inches*. Having an 11-inch (or smaller) screen has been shown to adversely affect student performance.

Student laptops should be using OS X 10.8.5 or higher, ideally 10.11.4 (El Capitan). *This rules out some older MacBook models.* If you have any questions, feel free to connect with your instructor!
